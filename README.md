# Timoshenko-Oscillator-Simulation
This project animates a simplified version of the Timoshenko oscillator (A.K.A. Friction Oscillator) based on equations of motion which have been anyltically derived. This simulation was inspired by problem 13 of the 2020 International Young Physicists' Tournament.
